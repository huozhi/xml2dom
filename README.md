### About

[中文README](https://github.com/lavende/FastSAX/blob/master/README.zh-CN.md)

This is a non-validating SAX parser for XML written in JAVA. Parse XML and output like the DOM readable style.

Have been not using Java for a while... Aha, It's a friendly language. And I thought that we should combine the practice of **design pattern** with building applications by pure oritened language such as Java.
